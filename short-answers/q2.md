# Question

Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer

You need a label for your input for accessability but also to give your selected input a greater surface area to interact with. You can associate the label with an input by using the `for` attribute or by placing your input directly into the label tag.

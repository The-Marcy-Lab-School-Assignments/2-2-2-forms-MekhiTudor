<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

the default behavior of a button is to submit.
So the first and second button would just submit.
The second button would reset the form/page.
The last button would submit also.

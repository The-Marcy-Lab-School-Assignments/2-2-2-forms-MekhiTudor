# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

the default behavior of a button is to submit.
So the first and second button would just submit.
The second button would reset the form/page.
The last button would submit also.

# Teacher Feedback

So close! You are correct, the first two buttons would submit and the **third** button would rest but the last button would not have any default behavior unless some custom behavior was added!
